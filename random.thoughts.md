# general

# remove DOM element on hide
  - simple appendChild and removeChild in case order is not important
  - use placeholder empty TextNode when removing
  - parentNode.replaceChild(newChild, oldChild)

# component/node collections
  - coded(object key/value) / array 
  - form elements
  - tab buttons 
  - tab & navigation content (order not important, can be removed from dom and returned instad of hide)

navigation can have two different components to show versus to forward data,
and it is usually when there are some extra elements around that component to be shown a well (title, or extra buttons)
    - use 2 separate collections and assume one is default (this.$content + $this.$area)
    - or use some marking to signify that show/hide is not same as the navigation component 

forms can also have this dual situation where show/hide differs from getValue/setValue.
because you want to show hide the whole section with the label (not just the input)

there are some situations where one component should be part of multiple collections
 -- TODO find example(can't remember right now)


# forms CSS
 - https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/forms/#form-groups
 - .form-group .form-control .form-inline

# Use case for `base/Button` 
 - fires action event to parent directly
 - parent does not have to add listener to each button, just add `on_actionName` method
 - transient component should forward the event to the parent
 - simple directive as button needs not even be a component45
 - navigation button that uses `<a href` and thus even enables link copy and open in new window 

# component initialization
  - component is contructed ( `construct` )
    - define
  - if lazyInit nothing else happens until visible or initialized
    - if component does not have a parent and is visible already initialize it anyway so root component is started properly as expected by the user
  - `__init` - do initialization if not done already (safe to call multiple times)
  - `afterParentInit` ( in this pahse all children are created but their tempalte is not applied yet )
  - `initTemplate` ( apply template and construct children, at this stage it is like all children are lazy-initialized )
  - `afterInitTemplate`
  - `initChildren` ( initTemplate for each child that is "not lazyInit and hidden" )

# useful boolean attributes in html
  - disabled
  - required
  - selected
  - checked
  - readOnly
  - open

initializing component template has few use cases.
 - a node without children and component that has html defined to put inside

# cleanup
 - remove leftovers of previous approach to inputs 
   - remove support for augmenting `<input>` fields and `<form>` elements 
   - abandon `<form>` element as it fails for nested forms (editing object graph)
 - rethink if distinction between augmented html node and real component is needed
   - augmented node has no other information except the node reference
 - refactor Table, remove onclick handler and move it to base/ClickableRow maybe

# event (and direction for fire)
 - Button - fire to parent (dir:down, hops:1) or (call on parent, hops:0)
 - visibility(show/hide) - fire to children to notify visibility changed (propagation based on visibility)
 - RenderTable - fire to parent (dir:down, hops:1) or (call on parent, hops:0)
 - List - forward dir:down events, preserve hops

## components delegating stuff to parent (transitive)
 - transitive components are just placeholders, used by some other component
   - example1: `base/Loop` with multiple copies of a component (multi address editor)
 - When extending, component can be made non-transitive again by overriding `isTransitive` to `return false`
 - event should be recognized somehow so transitive component can forward it up or down
 - filtering is transitive for transitive component
 - if multiple functionalities can have different behavior for transitive component
  - ? how to handle situation when you want to have partial transitive behavior

## components firing events down to parent
 - should have event="xxx" attribute to change event name
 - should have action="xxx" attribute to enable one event handler handlig similar actions
   - example: event="changeLanguage" action="en"
   - example: event="delete" action="archive"
   - example: event="rowClick" action="preview"

# component control directly in template (binding/observable)
 - simple situations like enable, disable
 - if nothing else is needed except those simple tasks do it via template
 - revisit component reference approach versus template defined control



## show/hide event
 - [x] parent show:
   - [x] visible child: forward
   - [x] hidden  child: ignore
 - [x] parent hide:
   - [x] visible child: forward
   - [x] hidden  child: ignore
 - [x] check parent visibility before firing (if parent is hiden hide was fired already)
 - [x] initial show event must be fired to avoid incosistencies

# data source
 - syntax like filters (name and parameters separated by commas)
 - yesNo

# filters
 - filters a value to another value (number,string,object) 
 - some textual filter examples: date, datetime, datetime-with-seconds ... etc 
 - some are locale specific
   - date (31.12.2015)
   - decimal (1.000,00 or 1,000.00 )
 - filter(x,'date') returns x filtered as date 
 - filter(x,['decimal',2]) returns x filtered as decimal (options:[2] , understood as 2 decimal places)
 - null handling
   - ifNull,empty 

## filters in transitive components
 - is local filtering needed ? 
 - maybe work on nicer looking data transformation when preparing for ViewPort

## renderers
 - render HTML (for short filtered texts without using components)
 - __actually it is a regualr filter, but receiving side mut allow the HTML to be injected and not converted to plain text__
 - 

# unify array/map for components
  - components sometimes follow organization like object graph
  - a simple component can be regarded like a simple value in object graph
  - components grouped by key/value are similar to objects and maps
  - components repeated with just ordering (key being the location in the array is array like organization)
  - common operations
    - array: push(c) , map: add(key,c)
    - array: remove(key), map: remove(key)
    - array: remove(c), map: remove(c)  ... compare object and remove the key as well
    - array: slice(index,count, insert extra...) ... useful array manipulation func
    - array: move(c, cBefore)
    - array: insertBefore(c, cBefore)
    - array: insert(c, index) ... alias to slice(index,0,c)
    - array: indexOf(c):key  map:indexOf()  ... makes sense even for map if needed 

# inline loop
```html
<table as="base/Loop" template>
  <tr  template>
    <td p="leftColumns" loop as="base/CheckBox">${}</td>
    <td>Divider</td>
    <td p="rightColumns" loop="base/Loop" as="base/Button">${}</td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="footer">
    <td>...</td>
  </tr>
</table>


```

# inline loop JSX
```html
<table>
  <tbody as="base/Loop" p="userLoop">
    {mi2.inline((state)=>(
      <tr as="Base">
        <td>
          {state.tonnage}
        </td> 
        <td>
          {state.name}
        </td>
      </tr>
    ))}
  </tbody>
</table>
```


# loop without parent
```html
{mi2.loop(()=>state.users,
  (user={})=(
    <label>{user.name}</label>
  )
)}

<Loop src={state.users}>
{mi2.simple((user={})=>(
  <label>{user.name}</label>
))}
</Loop>

<Loop src={state.users} tpl={(user={})=><label>{user.name}</label>}/>

```


# RenderTable
examples of column config
```javascript
date:{
    title: t('date'),
    filter: 'date',
}
```

parameters inside template
```html
<cell-age-template></cell-age-template>
<cell-template col="age"></cell-template>
```

# template for components
 - make parser inspect and use all dom elements even inside a component, unless `template` attribute is present
 - this means child component parsing is deferred until all current nodes are checked to avoid the component changing the DOM
 - this will allow a component to access all that is defined in it's own template even if placed inside another
 - components that will allow the parent to have things placed inside them (tab component or alike) will have to account for it. There is already a way to get references to already instantiated components from the parent

# template format and transformation
```html
- ${propname:filter} -
  <tpl-text p="text.propname" filter="filter"></tpl-text>
- ${birthday:ifNull,unknown,date}
  <tpl-text p="text.birthday" filter="ifNull,unknown,date"></tpl-text>
- <div>${age:intStr}</div>
  <div><tpl-text p="text.age" filter="intStr"></tpl-text></div>
```

# inputs for numbers
 - communication type (int, float)
  - display filter (language specific: 1.00 1,00)
  - null incomming: empty or zero
  - null/empty outgoing (domNode.value is null) is null or zero ? config ?
  - parsing more forgiving than filter ( nice option is to use last decimal as decimal and ignore rest)
    - 1.000,01 -> 1000.01
    - 100,1 -> 100.1
    - 1,2,3,4 -> 123.4 (unlikely user will type this, but)
  - [x] onchange refilter (parse+filter) to display what was understood
  - [x] validation options (min,max,required)


# validation
 - define fields to skip  
    - if needed for dsiabling validation fo fields that are not currently used due to some reason
    - example: checkbox for advanced options (if disabled, do not validate theose options)
 - validate input text (out filter can interfere, need to use getRawValue)
 - required validation can be done also via value, if input returns null for empty value
 - validate input values
 - custom validation for values
 - async validation for values
 - rethink form validation
   - ? remove label reference and info box reference
 - rethink validation error filter
   - for combining form default validation and custom validation after
   - filter for getting validation error from server
   - for easier adding validation errors
   - ? validation object with some utiliy metohds
