#mi2js

A JS library, maturing slowly, still trying to stay small.

# Goals
These are guiding thoughts when adding, removing, changing the functionalities
 - create usefull utilities
 - keep utility as simple as possible and as short as possible
 - remove features from the utility that complicate implementing the utility
  - ask: will I ever need this really ?
  - if it can be usefull, maybe make it as an example or extension
 - less code
 - minimizer friendly 
 - avoid too shot variable names ( I tend to break this one often :D ) 
 - simpler code will likely bring less bugs :)
 - help code using the utilities be simple nad readable
